# VSCodeMinimal
 An extremely minimalistic, white on black, focus-oriented Settings.json for Visual Studio Code, with an optimized font I adjusted from Droid Monospace -- with easily visible emphasized dots, and strongly separating otherwise easy-to-confuse character couples like "{" vs "(", "O" vs "0", or ";" vs ":". New keyboard settings also let you tab the tabs directly with Ctrl+Shift, and makes the behavior of moving with Ctrl+Left/Right more like in other editors (e.g. jumping to the word start, not the next dot in the middle of it).

To install this, grab the Extension Theme "Black and White" which this overrides, then search the VS Code settings for settings.json and replace the file. Also, right-click the TTF font and click Install (you will need to restart VS Code for this to take effect).

The keybindings file needs to be replaced at
  %UserProfile%\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\

Have fun!
